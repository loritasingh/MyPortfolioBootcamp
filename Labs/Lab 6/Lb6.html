    <strong>What exactly is a favicon?</strong>
    <p>A favicon is a shortcut icon that is associated with a specific webpage.Favicon's serve as branding for your website by using an icon or logo to alert users to your page. Favicon's are very small in size and often times need to be a smaller version of your logo and can be seen in your tabs, bookmarks, and search bars.  </p>
    <b>How are favicon's created?</b>
    <p>Favicon's are created using websites such as code.org. In these websites you can use numbers and letters to create your own unique logo or icon, these icons are created in pixelated format and have a readable format available as well. With the combination of letters, numbers, design, and your imagination the possibilities are endless.  </p>
    <b>How did I create the favicon for this site?</b>
    <p>I created this favicon for this site by using different sets of numbers and letters. I started off with using the color black for my border, and ended up creating color in the middle. I copied and pasted my design a few times and tweaked it until I liked the outcome. The colors are synchronous and the step like design creates an abstract art that is my own version of a beautiful mess.</p>
